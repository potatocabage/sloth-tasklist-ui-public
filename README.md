I'm not familiar with using github so I wasn't able to upload ALL of the code into this repository. That being said you should be able to run the code by opening a new Flutter project in Andriod Studio, replacing your main.dart with the one in the repository, and changing the dependencies in your pubspec.yaml to match the one in the repository.
